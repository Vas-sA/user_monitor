user_monitor - script for monitoring your pc activity. It makes screenshot and store processes data with custom interval(default=60sec)

It may be usefull if you want to track your social nets surfing and/or resources use.

*for me it was usefull if I lose some mind = watching screenshots story is much more efficient to remind somethings

screenshots_data - script which generates .csv file with filename and which logotype it include (require screenshots and logos dir)
